    "\n",
    "[What is a SIEM?](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/operations/what-is-siem.html) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is software that improves security awareness of an IT environment by combining security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). SIEM solutions enhance threat detection, compliance, and security incident management through the gathering and analysis of real-time and historical security event data and sources. SIEM main capabilities provide a broad range of log event collection and management, increasing the ability to analyze log events and other data across dissimilar sources, and operational capabilities including incident management, dashboards, and reporting. SIEM also offers data aggregation across the enterprise network and normalization of that data for further analysis. Additionally, SIEM helps enable security monitoring, user activity monitoring, and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splunk\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most widely known tools for developing a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system. Splunk has been used for a number of years, and by many organisations round the world. It essentially provides the mechanism to ingest and search data at scale, meaning that it is well-suited for machine data such as machine-generated logging. However the use cases of Splunk actually extend beyond cyber security to various other big data analysis domains. Users can search data using the Splunk Query Language, a similar concept to that of Structured Query Language used for common databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range): The Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user is able to quickly build a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a production environment.\n",
    "2. The Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as Atomic Red Team or Caldera in order to generate real attack data.\n",
    "3. It integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### elastic\n",
    "\n",
    "elastic (formerly known as ELK stack) is a suite of big data analytic tools: ElasticSearch, LogStash and Kibana. These are often used to construct a SIEM environment. The following examples come from the elastic repository, describing the use of Machine Learning for various cyber security tasks.\n",

    "### tcpdump\n",
    "\n",
    "As perhaps the simplest approach for obtaining network packet capture data, **tcpdump** is a Linux command line tool that can achieve this easily. Wireshark is a popular cross-platform tool with GUI. tshark is the command line version of wireshark, and pyshark is a Python wrapper that interacts with tshark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst we can use pyshark within a traditional Python script file (\\*.py), it can cause some issues with the Jupyter Lab environment - so for now we will examine tcpdump outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to capture tcpdump activity frrom within Jupyter Lab we can do the following:\n",
    "`output = !sudo tcpdump -c 100 -nn`\n",
    "\n",
    "(The exclamation mark indicates a bash command to execute, that will then be stored in our Python variable named *output*. The ability to combine bash scripting with Python scripting is just one benefit of the Jupyter environment.)"

    "## Intrusion Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suricata\n",
    "\n",
    "[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS). According to the homnepage, *'Suricata is the leading independent open source threat detection engine. By combining intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM) and PCAP processing, Suricata can quickly identify, stop, and assess the most sophisticated attacks'*. Here we will describe briefly some of the setup and usage of the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation in Ubuntu is via the usual apt-get mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install suricata`\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration is in `/etc/suricata`, default rules exist in `/etc/suricata/rules` and logging is in `/var/log/suricata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can edit the configuration using `sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`\n",
    "\n",
    "(YAML is \"Yet Another Markup Language!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Suricata can be launched as follows (specifying the network adapter that we wish to monitor):\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i ens33  --init-errors-fatal`\n",
    "\n",
    "On start up this will populate the rulesets using the emergingthreats.net site.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can stop/restart suricata using the service command in Ubuntu:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sudo service suricata stop/restart`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing the log data:** Logging is captured in the `/var/log/suricata/eve.json` file (event file). Some useful ways to interact with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wc eve.json` (will print out the number of lines, number of words and number of bytes).\n",
    "- `head eve.json -n 10` (will print out the first/top 10 lines, i.e. the oldest)\n",
    "- `tail eve.json -n 10` (will print out the last/bottom 10 lines, i.e. the most recent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful tool to know about for managing log data is [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). This is a light-weight tool for parsing and searching JSON documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install jq`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tail eve.json -n 10 | jq '.'` - this will do as above, but then will pipe the result to jq which will format the result on the CLI.\n",
    "- `cat eve.json | jq 'select(.event_type==\"flow\")'` - specify a matching query\n",
    "- `cat eve.json | jq 'select(.src_ip==\"192.168.147.147\" and .proto==\"UDP\")'`- specify multiple matching queries\n",
    "- `cat eve.json | jq 'select(.src_port > 40000)'` - specify a range query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing the log data using Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method is to use Pandas and the Jupyter Lab environment. Below we show an example of accessing these using the Pandas library. For completeness, we first extract the eve.json from our virtual machine using SCP (secure copy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `scp uwe@192.168.147.146:/var/log/suricata/eve.json .`  (copy from the Ubuntu source directory to our current target directory)"

It incorporates a number of the tools used today - Splunk, Suricata, osquery, Microsoft ATA, and more. It manages log generation and collection. It has Active Directory built in. This is a perfect set up for testing offensive and defensive security measures against a realistic virtualised infrastructure, without taking hours (or possibly days) to set up.\n",
