Recently, there has been growing interest in the domain of adversarial machine learning, which explores how a machine learning model can be compromised by an adversary, resulting in misclassified output. Whilst to date, most focus has been given to visual domains, the challenge is present in all applications of machine learning where a malicious attacker would want to cause unintended functionality, including cyber security and network traffic analysis. We first present a study on conducting adversarial attacks against a well-trained network traffic classification model. We show how well-crafted adversarial examples can be constructed so that known attack types are misclassified by the model as benign activity. To combat this, we present a novel defensive strategy based on hierarchical learning to help reduce the attack surface that an adversarial example can exploit within the constraints of the parameter space of the intended attack. Our results show that our defensive learning model can withstand crafted adversarial attacks and can achieve classification accuracy in line with our original model when not under attack.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2023mills.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2023mills.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="mills2023longitudinal" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Longitudinal Risk-based Security Assessment of Docker Software Container Images</div> <div class="author"> Alan Mills, Jonathan White, and <em>Phil Legg</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computers and Security</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823003887" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As the use of software containerisation has increased, so too has the need for security research on their usage, with various surveys and studies conducted to assess the overall security posture of software container images. To date, there has been very little work that has taken a longitudinal view of container security to observe whether vulnerabilities are being resolved over time, as well as understanding the real-world implications of reported vulnerabilities, to assess the evolving security posture. In this work, we study the evolution of 380 software container images across 3 analysis periods between July 2022 and January 2023 to analyse maintenance and vulnerabilities factors over time. We sample across the 3 DockerHub categories: Official, Verified and OSS (Sponsored) Open Source Software. We found that the number of vulnerabilities present increased over time despite many containers receiving regular updates by providers. We also found that the choice of container OS can dramatically impact the number of reported vulnerabilities present over time, with Debian-based images typically having many more vulnerabilities that other Linux distributions, and with some containers still reporting vulnerabilities that date back as far as 1999. However, when taking into account additional reported attributes such as the attack vector required and the existence of a public exploit rated higher than negligible, we found that for each analysis period, less than 1% of all vulnerabilities present what we would consider as high risk real-world impact. Through our investigation, we aim to improve the understanding of the threat landscape posed by software containerisation that is further complicated by the discrepancies between different vulnerability reporting tools.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024millscyberfunfair.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024millscyberfunfair.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="mills2024cyber" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cyber Funfair: Creating Immersive and Educational Experiences for Teaching Cyber Physical Systems Security</div> <div class="author"> Alan Mills, Jonathan White, and <em>Phil Legg</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In SIGCSE 2024: Proceedings of the 55th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630820#:%C2%A0:text=To%20address%20this%20need%2C%20we,device%20with%20LEGO%20SPIKE%20kits." class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024bamohabbat.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024bamohabbat.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="chafjiri2024vulnerability" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Vulnerability detection through machine learning-based fuzzing: A systematic review</div> <div class="author"> Sadegh Bamohabbat Chafjiri, <em>Phil Legg</em>, Jun Hong, and Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computers &amp; Security</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824002050" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024leggadvances.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024leggadvances.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="legg2024advances" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Advances in Teaching and Learning for Cyber Security Education</div> <div class="author"> <em>Phil Legg</em>, Natalie Coull, and Charles Clarke </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77524-6" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-77524-6" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This book showcases latest trends and innovations for how we teach and approach cyber security education. Cyber security underpins the technological advances of the 21st century and is a fundamental requirement in today’s society. Therefore, how we teach and educate on topics of cyber security and how we overcome challenges in this space require a collective effort between academia, industry and government. The variety of works in this book include AI and LLMs for cyber security, digital forensics and how teaching cases can be generated at scale, events and initiatives to inspire the younger generations to pursue cyber pathways, assessment methods that provoke and develop adversarial cyber security mindsets and innovative approaches for teaching cyber management concepts. As a rapidly growing area of education, there are many fascinating examples of innovative teaching and assessment taking place; however, as a community we can do more to share best practice and enhance collaboration across the education sector. CSE Connect is a community group that aims to promote sharing and collaboration in cyber security education so that we can upskill and innovate the community together. The chapters of this book were presented at the 4th Annual Advances in Teaching and Learning for Cyber Security Education conference, hosted by CSE Connect at the University of the West of England, Bristol, the UK, on July 2, 2024. The book is of interest to educators, students and practitioners in cyber security, both for those looking to upskill in cyber security education, as well as those aspiring to work within the cyber security sector.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="legg2024privacy" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Privacy-Based Triage of Suspicious Activity Reports Using Offline Large Language Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Phil Legg</em>, Nicholas Ryder, Samantha Bourton, Diana Johnson, and Reuben Walker </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Advancements in Cyber Crime Investigations and Modern Data Analytics</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.1201/9781003471103/advancements-cyber-crime-investigations-modern-data-analytics-shishir-kumar-shandilya-devangana-sujay-gupta" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) form a vital part of incident response and case management for the investigation of known or suspected money laundering. However, those submitting SARs, and those tasked with analysing SARs, often find the task overwhelming due to the complexity of reporting, the incompleteness of information available, and the ability to classify reports effectively for further processing. We explore the use of Natural Language Processing to facilitate this process. Specifically, we utilise the recent advances of Large Language Models to understand and classify SARs against the glossary code terms set out by the UK National Crime Agency. We also explore the privacy concerns of handling confidential and sensitive data with recent AI advancements and propose the use of offline open-source models, coupled with bespoke fine-tuning, to improve task-specific performance using a model that can be deployed locally without requiring data to be shared with external third parties. Our results show that this approach can yield effective classification accuracy on our test cases, offering a solution to develop bespoke smaller, offline models that maintain privacy and confidentiality, over online models that would compromise data privacy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024lotrist.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024lotrist.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="lo2025trist" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">TRIST: Towards a Container-Based ICS Testbed for Cyber Threat Simulation and Anomaly Detection</div> <div class="author"> C.

These incidents caused widespread service disruptions and substantial economic losses, underscoring the urgent need for an in-depth understanding of cyber threats in industrial environments. Industrial security research is usually conducted on physical testbeds to avoid safety issues, production interruptions and other operational constraints in industrial processes. Nevertheless, security defenders often encounter obstacles in developing or accessing physical testbeds due to associated costs and complexities. These factors hinder research progress to devise early detection mechanisms for cyber threats—essential for effective incident response. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a container-based virtual testbed. Its lightweight architecture enables replicable and efficient deployment of testbeds at low cost for simulating cyber threats on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—the cornerstone of industrial automation and control systems. Also, the container-based virtual testbed provides a cost-effective option for producing datasets for training, testing and optimization of unsupervised anomaly detection models.

These attacks manipulate LLMs to divulge sensitive information or generate harmful content, that could further be utilised in nefarious ways, including as part of cyber-enabled crime, hence presenting a crucial cyber security challenge for the safe and secure interaction of AI-enabled systems. Previous studies highlight the security challenges posed by multi-turn interactions, in which attackers strategically conceal their malicious intent through extended conversations. However, the influence of tense variations on the efficacy of such attacks has received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically examining the role of tense manipulation in multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs. We introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreak attack that specifically exploits past tense reformulation, along with a multi-turn dialogue dataset designed for cyber-related attacks. Experiments conducted on both open-source LLMs (Llama 2-7B, Qwen 2-7B) and closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2-flash) demonstrate that past tense reformulation significantly enhances attack performance, yielding an average increase of 25.30% with larger effect on closed-source models. These findings highlight the urgent need to strengthen LLM defence strategies against tense variations in multi-turn dialogues.

However, these networks face substantial challenges to ensure privacy and security, specifically in a Federated Learning (FL) setup, where adversarial attacks can potentially influence the model integrity. Conventional privacy-preserving FL mechanisms are often susceptible to such attacks, leading to degraded model performance and severe security vulnerabilities. To address this issue, we propose FL with adversarial optimisation framework to improve adversarial robustness in 5G edge computing networks while ensuring privacy preservation. The proposed framework considers two models; a classifier model and an adversary model, where the classifier model is integrated with the adversary model, trained jointly considering Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) for generation of adversarial perturbations. This adversarial optimisation enhances classifier’s resilience to attacks, thereby improving both privacy preservation and model accuracy. Experimental analysis reveals that the proposed model achieves up to 99.44% accuracy on adversarial test data, while improving robustness and sustaining high precision and recall across varying client scenarios. The experimental results further ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of communication efficiency and computational efficiency while reducing inference time and FLOPs making it ideal for secure 5G edge computing applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2026lo.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2026lo.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="LO2026108382" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">LOTL-hunter: Detecting multi-stage living-off-the-land attacks in cyber-physical systems using decision fusion techniques with digital twins</div> <div class="author"> Carol Lo, Thu Yein Win, Zeinab Rezaeifar, Zaheer Khan, and <em>Phil Legg</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Future Generation Computer Systems</em>, 2026 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2026.108382" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The integration of smart sensors and actuators in industrial environments has expanded the cyber-physical attack surface, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish anomalies caused by cyberattacks from those due to mechanical or electrical faults. This challenge is exacerbated by stealthy, multi-stage attacks leveraging Living off the Land (LOTL) techniques, which often evade conventional anomaly detection or intrusion detection systems (IDS). This study presents a Digital Twin-based testbed for safe, repeatable simulation of multi-stage cyber-physical attacks targeting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We propose a two-level decision fusion method that aggregates and aligns anomalies across network, process, and host domains in synchronized 1-minute intervals. The first-level fusion improves OT-layer detection by applying confidence-aware decision logic to outputs combined from (a) a supervised deep learning model (LSTM-FCN) for process anomalies, (b) an unsupervised model (Isolation Forest) for OPC UA network anomalies, and (c) process alarm signals. The second-level fusion integrates these results with host-based anomalies, computed through point-based scoring of Wazuh alerts, to provide comprehensive IT/OT situational awareness. Experimental results demonstrate improved detection of stealthy, multi-stage APT attack behaviours. Additionally, Large Language Models (LLM) provide summarization of the integrated IT/OT anomaly logs into human-readable insights, enhancing interpretability and supporting cyber threat hunting.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%50%68%69%6C.%4C%65%67%67@%75%77%65.%61%63.%75%6B" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-phil-legg" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="https://medium.com/@plegg" title="Medium" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-medium"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3460-5609" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tn43ogoAAAAJ&amp;hl" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://youtube.com/@youtube.com/@phillegg347" title="YouTube" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i></a> <a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/PhilLegg" title="Work" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Prof. Phil Legg.
