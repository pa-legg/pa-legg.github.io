Recently, there has been growing interest in the domain of adversarial machine learning, which explores how a machine learning model can be compromised by an adversary, resulting in misclassified output. Whilst to date, most focus has been given to visual domains, the challenge is present in all applications of machine learning where a malicious attacker would want to cause unintended functionality, including cyber security and network traffic analysis. We first present a study on conducting adversarial attacks against a well-trained network traffic classification model. We show how well-crafted adversarial examples can be constructed so that known attack types are misclassified by the model as benign activity. To combat this, we present a novel defensive strategy based on hierarchical learning to help reduce the attack surface that an adversarial example can exploit within the constraints of the parameter space of the intended attack. Our results show that our defensive learning model can withstand crafted adversarial attacks and can achieve classification accuracy in line with our original model when not under attack.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2023mills.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2023mills.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="mills2023longitudinal" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Longitudinal Risk-based Security Assessment of Docker Software Container Images</div> <div class="author"> Alan Mills, Jonathan White, and <em>Phil Legg</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computers and Security</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823003887" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As the use of software containerisation has increased, so too has the need for security research on their usage, with various surveys and studies conducted to assess the overall security posture of software container images. To date, there has been very little work that has taken a longitudinal view of container security to observe whether vulnerabilities are being resolved over time, as well as understanding the real-world implications of reported vulnerabilities, to assess the evolving security posture. In this work, we study the evolution of 380 software container images across 3 analysis periods between July 2022 and January 2023 to analyse maintenance and vulnerabilities factors over time. We sample across the 3 DockerHub categories: Official, Verified and OSS (Sponsored) Open Source Software. We found that the number of vulnerabilities present increased over time despite many containers receiving regular updates by providers. We also found that the choice of container OS can dramatically impact the number of reported vulnerabilities present over time, with Debian-based images typically having many more vulnerabilities that other Linux distributions, and with some containers still reporting vulnerabilities that date back as far as 1999. However, when taking into account additional reported attributes such as the attack vector required and the existence of a public exploit rated higher than negligible, we found that for each analysis period, less than 1% of all vulnerabilities present what we would consider as high risk real-world impact. Through our investigation, we aim to improve the understanding of the threat landscape posed by software containerisation that is further complicated by the discrepancies between different vulnerability reporting tools.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024leggadvances.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024leggadvances.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="legg2024advances" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Advances in Teaching and Learning for Cyber Security Education</div> <div class="author"> <em>Phil Legg</em>, Natalie Coull, and Charles Clarke </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77524-6" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-77524-6" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This book showcases latest trends and innovations for how we teach and approach cyber security education. Cyber security underpins the technological advances of the 21st century and is a fundamental requirement in today’s society. Therefore, how we teach and educate on topics of cyber security and how we overcome challenges in this space require a collective effort between academia, industry and government. The variety of works in this book include AI and LLMs for cyber security, digital forensics and how teaching cases can be generated at scale, events and initiatives to inspire the younger generations to pursue cyber pathways, assessment methods that provoke and develop adversarial cyber security mindsets and innovative approaches for teaching cyber management concepts. As a rapidly growing area of education, there are many fascinating examples of innovative teaching and assessment taking place; however, as a community we can do more to share best practice and enhance collaboration across the education sector. CSE Connect is a community group that aims to promote sharing and collaboration in cyber security education so that we can upskill and innovate the community together. The chapters of this book were presented at the 4th Annual Advances in Teaching and Learning for Cyber Security Education conference, hosted by CSE Connect at the University of the West of England, Bristol, the UK, on July 2, 2024. The book is of interest to educators, students and practitioners in cyber security, both for those looking to upskill in cyber security education, as well as those aspiring to work within the cyber security sector.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2024lotrist.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2024lotrist.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="lo2025trist" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">TRIST: Towards a Container-Based ICS Testbed for Cyber Threat Simulation and Anomaly Detection</div> <div class="author"> C.

These incidents caused widespread service disruptions and substantial economic losses, underscoring the urgent need for an in-depth understanding of cyber threats in industrial environments. Industrial security research is usually conducted on physical testbeds to avoid safety issues, production interruptions and other operational constraints in industrial processes. Nevertheless, security defenders often encounter obstacles in developing or accessing physical testbeds due to associated costs and complexities. These factors hinder research progress to devise early detection mechanisms for cyber threats—essential for effective incident response. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a container-based virtual testbed. Its lightweight architecture enables replicable and efficient deployment of testbeds at low cost for simulating cyber threats on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—the cornerstone of industrial automation and control systems. Also, the container-based virtual testbed provides a cost-effective option for producing datasets for training, testing and optimization of unsupervised anomaly detection models. Besides, an evaluation on resource consumption is conducted. The paper also discusses the benefits and limitations of proposed container-based ICS testbeds and suggests future research areas.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/2025legg.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="2025legg.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="legg2025machine" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Machine Learning and Data Analytics for Cyber Security</div> <div class="author"> <em>Phil Legg</em> and Giorgio Giacinto </div> <div class="periodical"> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/books/reprint/10756-machine-learning-and-data-analytics-for-cyber-security" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The aim of this reprint is to provide an overview of the current challenges within the cyber security community today, as recognized by our contributors.
