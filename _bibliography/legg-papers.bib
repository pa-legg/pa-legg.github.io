The sheer scale and harms caused by these crimes have led to calls for this to be viewed as a global public health issue, in need of an immediate and coordinated response. However, research into the nature of such online communities is largely limited in scope, with focus predominantly targeting potential perpetrators and their access to online communities (rather than the safeguarding activities of specific online platforms). This chapter seeks to bridge this gap, presenting work exploring the role played by online communities (i.e. through social media and gaming platforms) in preventing online child sexual abuse. Specifically, the chapter examines current practices utilised by such platforms (as well as challenges faced) in the fight against online child sexual abuse. This includes the impact of the ever-growing use of generative AI, as well as the need to hold technology companies to account for content hosted on their platforms, particularly considering the recently implemented Online Safety Act 2023.",

TITLE = {Federated Learning with Adversarial Optimisation for Secure and Efficient 5G Edge Computing Networks},

ABSTRACT = {With the evolution of 5G edge computing networks, privacy-aware applications are gaining significant attention due to their decentralised processing capabilities. However, these networks face substantial challenges to ensure privacy and security, specifically in a Federated Learning (FL) setup, where adversarial attacks can potentially influence the model integrity. Conventional privacy-preserving FL mechanisms are often susceptible to such attacks, leading to degraded model performance and severe security vulnerabilities. To address this issue, we propose FL with adversarial optimisation framework to improve adversarial robustness in 5G edge computing networks while ensuring privacy preservation. The proposed framework considers two models; a classifier model and an adversary model, where the classifier model is integrated with the adversary model, trained jointly considering Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) for generation of adversarial perturbations. This adversarial optimisation enhances classifier’s resilience to attacks, thereby improving both privacy preservation and model accuracy. Experimental analysis reveals that the proposed model achieves up to 99.44% accuracy on adversarial test data, while improving robustness and sustaining high precision and recall across varying client scenarios. The experimental results further ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of communication efficiency and computational efficiency while reducing inference time and FLOPs making it ideal for secure 5G edge computing applications.},
