As the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, attackers are increasingly exploiting Rust's cross-platform capabilities and unique features to create highly resilient malware. New emerging variants written in different languages can keep causing challenges as well, such as Zig. Recovering high-level type information from binaries is crucial for security analysis, vulnerability discovery, and legacy system maintenance. However, compilation often strips away symbols and type information, making it more difficult to analyse Rust-based malware. This study aims to bridge the research gap by exploring promising analysis strategies for Rust-based malware and providing information on the unique challenges posed by this emerging threat.
