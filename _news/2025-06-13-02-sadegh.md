Congratulations to Sadegh Bamohabbat Chafjiri who has today defended his PhD thesis, subject to minor amendments, entitled "Advancing Software Fuzzing Techniques Through the Exploration of Cryptographic Concepts and Machine Learning". Thank you to Lucas Cordeiro and Sarfraz Brohi PhD, FHEA for being excellent examiners with deep and thoughtful questioning to challenge and get the best out of his research, and thank you to Charlotte Crofts for chairing the viva. 

Sadegh has been an active member of our UWEcyber research community at University of the West of England since April 2022, and will soon be moving on to new academic opportunities. It has been a pleasure to have you as part of our group, and congratulations on a fantastic result!
