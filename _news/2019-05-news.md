Jonathan White (MSc Cyber Security student) has been awarded a NCSC Summer Internship to work on ``Improving cyber security in the home: detection, analysis, and understanding of IoT and home network threats for non-expert users.'' We also had the official launch event of our new Cyber Security enterprise studio, with Chris Skidmore MP, Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation. The studio will aims to bring students and industry closer to work on short projects. The initiative is supported by the Institute of Coding.
