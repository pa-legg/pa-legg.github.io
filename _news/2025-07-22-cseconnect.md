Thatâ€™s a wrap for our CSE Connect 5th Annual conference on Advances in Cyber Security Education 2025 that we have hosted this week at University of Warwick.

Thank you to all who have made it possible and supported to bring together an ever-growing international network across government, industry and academia to continue to challenge and enhance what we do in cyber security education. 

With colleagues joining from US, Canada, Australia, as well as across the UK, it has been incredible to see the enthusiasm and dedication of people in the cyber education ecosystem who want to connect, share and collaborate internationally.

I am always proud to see my team of #UWEcyber academics, students and alumni getting involved in this space presenting across the streams on topics of geo-politics of cyber, digital forensics and game-based learning, showcasing their education practice and sharing with the community.

Thank you to the team at Warwick for all their hard work on the local organisation and logistics of the event!!

And of course thank you to the CSE Connect team as we continue to grow and strengthen as a community with collaboration and our students at the heart of what and why we do it all

Shout outs to so many!
