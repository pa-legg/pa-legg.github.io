A fantastic evening at The National Cyber Awards to bring together the cyber community across academia, industry and government!!

It is a real honour that #UWEcyber University of the West of England was recognised as a hashtag#finalist for the second year in a row, up against some fantastic competitors, but the big congrats go to Aston University Cyber Security Innovation Research Centre who managed to take the top spot for Cyber University of the Year!

Wonderful to see so many familiar faces and to meet many new connections - especially those who said they’d come and be part of our #UWEcyber guest seminars - lots of industry and academic research collaborations to be made! 😄

Thanks to all the folks on our table - definitely the best whooping of the night!! 😃

Finally a massive congrats to Dr Clare Johnson who took Cyber Citizen of the year - keep doing your fantastic work!!
