It has been fun the last few evenings to work through and complete the recent Belkasoft #forensics #training! #cpd is crucial in both academia and tech - there is always more to learn and that's why I love it - and if I'm advocating that our #students complete these courses to help their #professional #development then I want to make sure I do it too!! (Even if that means burning the midnight oil!). Thanks Belkasoft - really nice tool and datasets for examining digital evidence acquired from a workstation.
