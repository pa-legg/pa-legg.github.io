I am working with colleagues in the Bristol Robotics Laboratory on the ``CAVForth'' project. This project is exploring the cyber security considerations around Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, to develop a fully autonomous bus for commuting on the Forth bridge in Edinburgh. I also acted as an External PhD Examiner at Cardiff University, reviewing work in the area of malware analysis and propagation via social networks.
