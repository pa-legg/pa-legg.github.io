Itâ€™s been a fantastic week at the [NCyTE Center](https://www.ncyte.net) #CyAD2025 Cyber Security Across Disciplines conference at Moraine Valley Community College, just outside of Chicago, where we have further forged international connections between [CSE Connect](https://www.cseconnect.org), the NCyTE Center and the CAE in Cybersecurity Community.

The CSE Connect team took part in two hashtag#panel sessions early in the conference on building international partnerships and ways we can strengthen collaboration between HE institutions on hashtag#cyber hashtag#security hashtag#education that have helped to kick off a number of opportunities. With AI hot on the agenda, how we utilise technology to enhance teaching and learning is more critical than ever before - with cross UK-US sharing and collaboration in play to advance this exciting work.

Thank you to the NCyTE team for being such welcoming hosts - Costis Toregas Stephen Miller Kyle Jones Tony Coulson @john sands and @michele robinson.

A pleasure to be able to share what we do in our team at hashtag#UWEcyber University of the West of England, as part of the National Cyber Security Centre and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology ACE-CSE programme, bringing together cyber education collaborations across the UK.

As CSE Connect continues to grow, plans for the future, and develops these important collaborations and connections, it is wonderful to work with my UK colleagues Dr Charles Clarke Natalie Coull ðŸŸ  Steph Aldridge ðŸŒµ John Madelin Nigel A. Jones to strengthen collaboration in hashtag#cyber hashtag#security hashtag#education
