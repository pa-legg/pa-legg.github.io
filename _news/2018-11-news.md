I am currently recruiting for a 3-year fully-funded PhD scholarship, working in the area of Cyber Security at UWE Bristol. This project aims to explore the utilisation of Blockchain technology within secure military defence environments, for sharing of collaborative supply chain documents that may contain both public and private elements. The project is funded jointly by UWE Bristol and Techmodal Ltd. Please get in touch if you are interested or would like to discuss this post further. Full details are available here.
