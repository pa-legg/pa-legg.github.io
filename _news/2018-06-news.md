I am attending the Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE) in New Orleans with colleagues from academia and government, as part of an initiative for developing a UK cyber security skills network. I am also presenting as part of the Bristol Festival of Learning, on the topic of "What do we really mean by Cyber Security?"
