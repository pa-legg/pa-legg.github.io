Working with three BSc Forensic Computing and Security students, Pennie Spruhan, Avin Karim, and Abbey Russell-Jeffrey, we hosted a workshop as part of the NCSC CyberSchoolsHub EmPowerCyber project. This was a one-day event where 800 year 8 girls across Gloucestershire attended to take part in cyber security and computer science challenges put on by industry and academia. We were delighted to be a part of this event, and it was fantastic to help inspire a new generation of computer scientists into cyber security.
