** Wrapping up on highlights before I sign off for Christmas with a bit of an AI-curated Rewind thanks to coauthor.studio ðŸ¤– ðŸ¤– ðŸ¤– - Wishing you all a very merry Christmas, a restful break to enjoy with your friends and family, and a prosperous start to 2025! - Phil **

Here's my 2024 LinkedIn Rewind, by Coauthor.studio:

2024 demonstrated how cyber security education thrives when academia, industry and research converge. A standout year for hashtag#UWEcyber as we expanded practical learning opportunities and research impact while maintaining our focus on student success.

Key developments that shaped our year:
â€¢ Launched Cyber Security Consultancy module with Leonardo and BMT - seeing our students tackle real-world challenges in autonomous systems security and AI frameworks
â€¢ MSc Cyber Security achieved 92% student satisfaction before successful handover to new programme leadership
â€¢ Expanded research with PhD students investigating Rust-based malware analysis and LLM security implications
â€¢ Successfully delivered CyberWEST workshops across Southwest England, supporting teachers with practical cyber security resources
â€¢ Shortlisted for National Cyber Awards' Cyber University of the Year

Three posts that particularly resonated with our community:

1. Our final year hashtag#undergraduate students completed industry projects with Leonardo and BMT - watching them grow in confidence while solving real security challenges is why we do what we do ðŸ˜„

3. Featured on ITV discussing QR code parking scams - showing how academic expertise can help protect our communities

Research highlights included publications on federated learning security, container-based cyber ranges, and cyber physical systems security. Personally, achieving CompTIA CASP+ and SecurityX certifications reminded me we never stop learning in this field.

Looking ahead to 2025: We're expanding our research capacity with three new positions, strengthening industry partnerships through our consultancy module, and continuing our weekly guest seminar series bringing industry expertise directly to students.

To our fantastic hashtag#UWEcyber team, industry partners, and especially our students - thank you for showing how practical security implementation and academic excellence can work hand in hand.
