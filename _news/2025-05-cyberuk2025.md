It‚Äôs been a busy old week in Manchester for #CYBERUK25. Fantastic to chat with many people on about our work at #UWEcyber University of the West of England as an National Cyber Security Centre Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education (ACE-CSE) and also as CSE Connect helping to bridge together and promote collaboration across academia, industry and government.

Great to see many existing partners that we continue to collaborate with on hashtag#research and hashtag#education, as well as forging new connections (and I know I missed lots of other people that I‚Äôd liked to have caught up with too!). In particular, it was really nice to see some of our former #students from ‚Äúa few years ago‚Äù üòú to learn more of the exciting opportunities they have discovered!

Now to recuperate, reflect, and build on hashtag#research and hashtag#education opportunities in #cyber #security‚Ä¶
