We welcomed two new PhD students to the UWEcyber group, Gwyn Wilkinson and Andrew McCarthy. They are both working with our industry collaborator, Techmodal, to support novel research initiatives in line with the needs of defence and national security. Gwyn is working in the area of privacy preserving techniques, and Andy is working in the area of adversarial machine learning.
