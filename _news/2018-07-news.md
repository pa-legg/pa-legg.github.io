Two undergraduate students have joined the Computer Science Research Centre that I am supervising as part of the UWE Summer Internship Scheme. Adam Chakof is working with myself and Dr. Fiona Carroll on visualising cyber space for non-expert users, and Anirudh Singh is working with myself and Prof. Jim Smith on understanding user confidence and trust when labelling data for machine learning classifiers.
