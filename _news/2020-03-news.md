Working with colleagues in the Faculty of Business and Law, and with Synalogik, we have successfully attracted InnovateUK funding for developing AI methods in risk analysis and assessment. We have also successfully secured an internship working with the NCSC in the area of malware visualisation. Our UWEcyber outreach work has continued, and three students, Thomas Higgs, Pennie Spruhan, and Avin Karim, have been running Scalectrix hacking events in schools around Bristol.
