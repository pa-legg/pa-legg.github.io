As part of CISSEUK, I co-organised Cyber Education 2022 at Roehampton University that saw industry, academia, and government come together to learn about cyber security education challenges, and display practical projects that address solutions. Alan Mills presented our recent paper OGMA: Visualisation for Software Container Security Analysis and Automated Remediation at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience. I hosted a one day workshop on Cyber Security and Policing research as part of the Cyber Security and Cyber Crime research cluster.
