I attended the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) annual education event, "Inspiring and educating future generations in cyber security". At the event, colleagues and I presented our work on developing a greater sense of community and sharing within UK cyber security education. We launched the UK Chapter of the Colloqium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE UK).
