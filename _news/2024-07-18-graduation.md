Wonderful to celebrate the success of our hashtag#UWEcyber hashtag#students yesterday at Bristol Beacon - our new home of hashtag#graduation for University of the West of England.

This is our 7th cohort of students to graduate from our NCSC-certified MSc Cyber Security since the programme began in 2018 when I was first invited to take up the role of Programme Leader. Our hashtag#UWEcyber team have worked tirelessly to continually enhance the programme, and over the years it has been phenomenal to see the opportunities that our graduates have gone on to pursue. This year, we achieved a student satisfaction of 92% from the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES 2024) that I am incredibly proud of, and I thank the hard work of my Deputy Programme Leader Jon White as well as module leaders Djamel Djenouri Mazhar Malik Jay Murphy Andrew McCarthy Sarfraz Brohi...PhD, FHEA Jon White Alan Mills Ian Johnson . It has been an honour to support so many talented students through this programme over the years, however it is now time for me to pass the programme leadership mantle to colleagues Faiza Medjek and Abdullahi Arabo Jr MEng,PhD,PGCHE,SFHEA,CSTP,NTF,IFNTF,CANTF to provide opportunities across our academic team and to carry on the success of the programme.

I am looking forward to supporting our undergraduate programme further working with Programme Leaders Aida Abzhaparova and Jay Murphy and bringing more industry crossover to enhance real-world student experience, as well as continuing to teach on the MSc programme, continuing to develop hashtag#UWEcyber hashtag#research with our growing PhD community and our industry partnerships, and continuing leadership of our NCSC-certified Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education (ACE-CSE).

Onward and upward for hashtag#TeamUWE hashtag#UWEcyber
