Today I had the pleasure of speaking to staff and students from the Centre for Cyber Security, Communications and Network Research (CSCAN) at University of Plymouth about "Artificial Intelligence, agents, and what does it mean for cyber security?" 

In the talk, we looked at how GPT models have evolved to Large Language Models, and how these enable text and code generation. We looked at agents starting with game-based reinforcement learning through to LLM agents that can take action based on available tools and actions. We then consider the implications of this in cyber security - both for rapid investigation of cyber data analytics such as recognising web server attacks and insider threat behaviours, as well as the risks of automated code generation and execution.

Thank you Nathan Clarke for inviting me to give the talk, and very happy to follow up with those who are interested to know more!
