It is an honour and a privilege to be appointed to the UK Government Cyber Advisory Board (GCAB) announced today as part of the [Plan for Change](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-to-supercharge-uk-cyber-sector). I look forward to working with UK government and board members to ensure that we can strengthen UK cyber resilience against threats as technologies and their use continue to evolve.

> Senior cybersecurity experts from defence, big tech companies, AI labs, academia and more are also advising the government on public sector cybersecurity. Cyber leaders from BAE Systems, Santander, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google DeepMind will form the new iteration of the Government Cyber Advisory Board, which will play a key role in supporting the government's goal to strengthen the public sectorâ€™s cyber resilience. This aligns with the government Cyber Security Strategy and underpins the delivery of secure digital services across government.
