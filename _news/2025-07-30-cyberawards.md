I am delighted to share that #UWEcyber University of the West of England has been shortlisted by The National Cyber Awards for #Cyber #University of the #Year for the second year in a row. This is a real testament to the hard work and dedication of our #UWEcyber team, in recognition of activities specifically over the last 12 months in further developing our programmes, continuing to enhance our student experience, our educational outreach across the region, our work on embedding industry collaborations, and striving to connect our students with the wider cyber security ecosystem in the UK and beyond.

Of course it would be an absolute honour for us win this award - however we fully know we have some fantastic competition alongside our fellow finalists Aston University Cyber Security Innovation Research Centre, Edinburgh Napier University, University of Southampton and University of Surrey - which ever way the results may go, we know we will be in good company come the evening of the awards at the end of September!!
