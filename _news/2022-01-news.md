We have launched our Cyber Security and Cyber Crime Cluster. We have started our Institute of Coding Cyber Skills Bootcamp, and we have started our Cyber Security Education Workshop for School Teachers. We have welcomed our January 2022 intake to our MSc Cyber Security programme. We have delivered another round of our Scale Up 4 Growth Gloucestershire workshop on cyber security to industry members, through our partnership with Gloucestershire College. We have welcomed a new PhD student, James Barrett, to the CSCT department who will work with Ribbon Communications on Cyber Security in 5G networks.
