I successfully completed the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Configuration training with Palo Alto Networks, to become a Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Academy Instructor. I presented our DASA-funded project on "Human-centric Active-learning for decision Support in Threat Exploration" at the DSTL Science and Technology Autonomy event. I am also delighted to announce that have recently been appointed to the position of Associate Professor of Cyber Security at UWE Bristol.
