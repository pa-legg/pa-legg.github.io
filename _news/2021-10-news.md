We have been successful in attracting funding to support the development of a new Cyber Security and Cyber Crime research cluster within the University. I was part of a panel for the "Future Impact Podcast" series, discussing the Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrencies. I successfully passed the CompTIA PenTest+ PT0-002, and gained the CompTIA Network Vulnerability Assessment (CNVP) recognition. I also acted as an External PhD Examiner at Kingston University, reviewing work in the area of steganography and encryption for mobile banking, and I served as an external assessor for the Open University in the development of a new Cyber Security distance learning module.
