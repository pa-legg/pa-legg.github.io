#CYBERUK24 - itâ€™s been a blast!!

Over the last two days I have enjoyed fantastic talks and discussions with cyber professionals across industry, academia and government. It was a delight to catch up with many existing colleagues and friends across other institutions, as well as make many new connections. Lots of ideas and notes to follow up on over the next few days!

Thank you for a fantastic event National Cyber Security Centre
