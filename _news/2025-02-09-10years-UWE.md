Whilst I've barely had time to stop and catch a breath this week, I wanted to do at least a short post to mark a bit of a milestone - hashtag#10years at University of the West of England. 

I'm immensely proud of what I have achieved in this time, and how much I have developed as an hashtag#academic. I'm also acutely aware of the increasing challenges and stress we face working in this sector - especially so in recent years - that makes me extremely grateful for my fantastic hashtag#colleagues, hashtag#students, and external hashtag#collaborators that I work with that make it all worthwhile, to be able to work on interesting hashtag#research problems, be able to hashtag#teach the subject that I love, continue to hashtag#learn about new technology, and hashtag#contribute to our wider ecosystem!! Thank you to all who have played a part in these hashtag#10years!!
