I presented research at the 1st Interdisciplinary Symposium on Organised Crime, on the topic of "Cybercrime and insider threat - can AI save us from these adversaries?", hosted by the Centre for Applied Legal Research at UWE Bristol. I also attended the South West Security Awareness Special Interest Group (SASIG) event in Bristol.
