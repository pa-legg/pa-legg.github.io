CISSEUK hosted a one-day workshop on how we teach students about `experience'. As the main barrier to entry for many students, academics consider how best to integrate experience as a skill that students can report on when interviewing for roles. It was a productive and insightful workshop with a number of interesting outcomes reported. We also took our BSc and MSc students on a field trip to Abertay University, to the Securitay Conference. This is a largest student-organised security conference in Europe, and was a fantastic opportunity to offer our students.
