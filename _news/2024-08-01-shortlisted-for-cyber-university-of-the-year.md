The incredible hashtag#UWEcyber team at University of the West of England received some amazing news earlier this weekâ€¦

We are delighted to have been shortlisted as finalists for The National Cyber Awards as Cyber University of the Year!! To be shortlisted for such an award is an immense honour and a testament to the incredible hard work that the whole team put in to promote cyber security education and research. As a National Cyber Security Centre Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education (ACE-CSE) we do a lot of work across our region to upskill, including the UnlockCyber outreach programme, a series of CyberWEST annual teacher training workshops working across the South West, and the InspireCyber female mentorship programme for students and school pupils, to name but a few. Our research portfolio continues to grow with fantastic collaborations underway with industry and government partners and both UK and International academic partners, exploring areas of defense and security, with examples including human-machine teaming to combat cyber threats and decision support systems for understanding operational security needs, working on cutting edge technologies across industrial IoT, industrial control systems, telecoms, AI, containerisation security, software security, and other emerging technologies. Finally, and perhaps the most important aspect to us, is making all this work visible to our students and exposing them to opportunities to get involved, through schemes like our weekly guest seminars, short-term research roles, and by embedding industry collaboration that draws on our active research within our teaching at all possible opportunities. We want our students to benefit and learn from the research and practice that our team are involved in, so that they are enriched as citizens embarking on their cyber careers.

We will see what comes for The National Cyber Awards late September - we know that we have tough competition from other excellent finalists that do fantastic work - but for now, just to be recognised as a finalist at this stage, we are hashtag#TeamUWE hashtag#UWEcyber, and we are incredibly grateful and proud!!
