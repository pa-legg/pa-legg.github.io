As we are rapidly approaching the end of the term, I first want to give a massive thank you to all who have supporting our hashtag#UWEcyber hashtag#guest hashtag#seminar so far this academic year - the turnout has been fantastic and the students have loved them! Thanks to this terms speakers: Mark Moore Tony Dawson Gareth Jones James Riley Scott Eggins Carol Lo James Barrett Dalila Khettaf Aimen Djemaa Sadegh Bamohabbat Fred Stinchcombe Zeba Khanam, PhD Amy Brooks Alsa Tibbit Jack M. Aida Abzhaparova

I am now on the hashtag#lookout for hashtag#speakers to join us in the Spring term - we have some fantastic speakers lined up already including Nikki Webb Lisa Forte Andrew Peck Laura Reilly Craig Porter - if you would like to visit us at University of the West of England and speak to hundreds of budding hashtag#Cyber hashtag#Security students (undergraduate and postgraduate) about the exciting things you do then please do get in touch!

Thank you!!
