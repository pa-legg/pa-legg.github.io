Happy New Year! To kick off 2025 it is a great pleasure to be able to share the final published CSE Connect proceedings - Advances in Teaching and Learning for Cyber Security Education, in collaboration with co-editors Natalie Coull and Dr Charles Clarke.

A massive thank you to all contributing authors that have made this possible, and for the contributions that can go on to inspire educators and practitioners in how we engage and promote cyber education. We are already in preparation for the CSE Connect 2025 event which we will be sharing more details including the Call for Papers later this month.
