Andrew McCarthy (3rd Year PhD student) has successfully been accepted for publication of his recent work, "Defending against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks using Hierarchical Learning: A case study on Network Traffic Attack Classification" in the Journal of Information Security and Applications. I also served as a PhD External Examiner for De Montfort University, Leicester, on the topic of re-identification attacks on anonymised databases.
