 I am serving as a guest editor for the MDPI [Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcp/topical_collections/MachineLearning_Cybersecurity), hosting a special issue on Machine Learning and Data Analytics for Cyber Security. I am also a co-organiser of the 7th International Conference on Cyber Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (ICCS) 2021 working with colleagues from Cardiff Metropolitan University and University of South Wales, to be hosted online early December. I am also the course director of the new Institute of Coding Skills Bootcamps in Cyber Security hosted by UWE which start this month. I am delighted to announce that I have been promoted by the University to the rank of Full Professor.
