Our recent work (Mills, Spyridopoulos, Legg) entitled ``Efficient and Interpretable Real-Time Malware Detection Using Random-Forest'' has been accepted for the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Situational Awareness (CyberSA). Alan Mills (2nd year BSc Forensic Computing and Security undergraduate at UWE) led the work on developing a light-weight Raspberry Pi malware classifier system that not only detects malware in real-time, but also allows users to examine and assess how the classifier has made the decision. He will present the work at this year's conference, which will be held at the University of Oxford in June.
