Virtual Machines are all well and good but get a bit time-consuming to set up and tear down. Docker is great for spinning environments up quickly, but may only give you the bare minimum or a CLI when you may want a bit more…</p> <p>So, I’ve been looking for a good way to have a remote desktop in a web browser for a virtual machine, that can be set up quickly.</p> <p>Enter Kasm. They have a set of Docker containers that support web remote desktop out of the box, and can quickly be deployed.</p> <p>Ubuntu Jammy Desktop— <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/ubuntu-jammy-desktop-vpn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/ubuntu-jammy-desktop-vpn</a></p> <p>Kali — <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/kali-rolling-desktop" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/kali-rolling-desktop</a></p> <p>One snag — I wanted to be able to use apt install within my environment. Adapting the official documentation, I would add the “— user root” to the Docker command.</p> <p>docker run --rm -it --user root --shm-size=512m -p 6901:6901 -e VNC_PW=password kasmweb/ubuntu-jammy-desktop-vpn:1.17.0</p> <p>docker run --rm -it --user root --shm-size=512m -p 6905:6901 -e VNC_PW=password kasmweb/kali-rolling-desktop:1.17.0</p> <p>(In this example I’ve put Kali on 6905 so that I can run both instances together).</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ibaUyz57iDV0VxtO-ziYyQ.png"></figure> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NQc12di2ZIJkbvtBehBX5Q.png"></figure> <p>From one line, I can now connect to <a href="https://localhost:6901" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://localhost:6901</a>, use kasm_user / password as the VNC credentials, and I have a Ubuntu desktop instance accessible that I can update and add new packages to quickly and easily!</p> <p>As I’m running two instances (Ubuntu and Kali) I can share between them as they are on the same local subnet (however ping is not available by default).</p> <p>apt update</p> <p>apt install iputils-ping</p> <p>I now have two different OSs running in two browser windows able to communicate — and it took about 20 seconds to set up!</p> <p><a href="https://kasmweb.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nice one Kasm</a>.</p> <p>P.S. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/kasmweb?page=1&amp;search=" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kasm Tech DockerHub</a> page shows a bunch of different OSs and applications that can all be deployed in the same web-based manner — they even have a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/doom" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Doom</a> image :)</p> <p>P.P.S. Kali may still require the update to the missing signing key that was widely documented recently — <a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/new-kali-archive-signing-key/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.kali.org/blog/new-kali-archive-signing-key/</a></p> <p>Next</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=01f3445146d1" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
